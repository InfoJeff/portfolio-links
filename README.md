Here is some of my front end portfolio work.

1 - https://reprod.azurewebsites.net  
The Plan Partner app project of which I completely built the following 2 components (React front end, C# mid tier, and SQL back end):    
Activity Types - https://reprod.azurewebsites.net/#/app/activitytypes  
Conversion Rates - https://reprod.azurewebsites.net/#/app/conversionrates     
(This is a working membership site, so you need to register a free account to see these components)
