Here is some of my front end portfolio work.

1 - The Plan Partner app project - I built these complete parts (React front end, and SQL back end):  
Activity Types - https://reprod.azurewebsites.net/#/app/activitytypes  
Conversion Rates - https://reprod.azurewebsites.net/#/app/conversionrates     
(This is an working membership site, so you need to register a free account to see these components)
